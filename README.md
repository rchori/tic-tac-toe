# Ð¡lassic Tic-Tac-Toe game in an unconventional way


**resources** folder contains media files, link to a trained facial shape predictor and the built classification model (open/closed eye), the dataset of a right eye with two states (open and closed)

**game.py** runs Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**model.py** builds the image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks

**open_closed_eye_detection.py** detects eye frame based on face_landmark_detection and identify whether the right eye is open or closed with the help of the classification model

**Note:** the appropriate distance between a web camera and an eye is about 30-40 cm

# How to play

1. Download game.py script and resources folder on to your computer (make sure to download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks via the link provided)
1. Make sure to install the needed libraries (tensorflow, cv2, cmake, dlib, pyglet)
1. Run game.py by python of the 3rd version

As a result, given your right eye is detected, you will see 3 windows: the playing field, the web camera stream, your right eye

# Game logic

* No Peripherals are used during the game
* Each cell is highlighted in turn
* To put a cross in a certain place, just close your eyes for a while
* If the cell is empty, you will hear the corresponding sound and a cross will appear at this place
* Otherwise, you will hear another sound with the ability to put a cross in a different place
* The game's over if you win, you lose, it's a tie, you quit
* You can quit the app by pressing the 'esc' button
* To restart the game, please execute the script once again
